    Notes:
        The OpenMPI package from archive includes a Debian patch that disables UCX to silence
        warnings when running on systems without RDMA hardware. This leads to the less performant
        "ob1" method being selected on Infiniband-enabled systems. By default, OpenMPI selects UCX
        when Infiniband devices are available. This default functionality is restored here.

        See:
        * https://sources.debian.org/src/openmpi/4.1.4-3/debian/patches/no-warning-unused.patch/#L24
        * https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/8367
        * https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/blob/v4.1.x/README#L763

    Todo:
        * This method may not be required in future. Recent versions of UCX do not seem to produce
          the warning messages in question. A bug is open with Debian to consider re-enabling UCX:
