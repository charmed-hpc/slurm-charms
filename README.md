[Juju](https://juju.is) charms for automating the Day 0 to Day 2 operations of the [Slurm workload manager](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html) ‚öñÔ∏èüêß

The `slurm-charms` repository is a collection of charmed operators that enables you to easily deploy, configure, and manage the Slurm workload manager.
Here's the current charms in the collection:

* [`sackd`](./charms/sackd/): the authentication and credential kiosk daemon for Slurm.
* [`slurmctld`](./charms/slurmctld/): the central management daemon for Slurm.
* [`slurmd`](./charms/slurmd): the compute node daemon for Slurm.
* [`slurmdbd`](./charms/slurmdbd): the database daemon for Slurm.
* [`slurmrestd`](./charms/slurmrestd/): the REST API interface to Slurm.

## ‚ú® Getting started

To deploy the Slurm charms from [Charmhub](https://charmhub.io), you must be using Juju 3.x or greater.

```shell
juju deploy sackd --channel edge
juju deploy slurmctld --channel edge
juju deploy slurmd --channel edge
juju deploy slurmdbd --channel edge
juju deploy slurmrestd --channel edge
juju deploy mysql --channel 8.0/stable
juju deploy mysql-router slurmdbd-mysql-router --channel dpe/edge

juju integrate sackd:login-node slurmctld:login-node
juju integrate slurmctld:slurmd slurmd:slurmctld
juju integrate slurmctld:slurmdbd slurmdbd:slurmctld
juju integrate slurmctld:slurmrestd slurmrestd:slurmctld
juju integrate slurmdbd-mysql-router:backend-database mysql:database
juju integrate slurmdbd:database slurmdbd-mysql-router:database

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

The project uses [tox](tox.wiki) as its command runner, which provides some useful commands that
will definitely help while hacking on the charms:

```shell
tox run -e fmt # Apply formatting standards to code.
tox run -e lint # Check code against coding style standards.
tox run -e type # Type checking.
tox run -e unit # Run unit tests.
```

We also have some integration tests in place, but be aware that it requires a fairly good amount
of computer resources to run them. We usually test with at least 4 cores and 16 GB of RAM, but feel
free to experiment!

```shell
tox run -e integration
```
